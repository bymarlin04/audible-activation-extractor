# audible-activation-extractor

A small and simple script to retrieve your personal Audible activation bytes. To use it, execute the python file and follow the steps. If you want to change your locale (used for the Audible Marketplace), set the environment variable `AUDIBLE_LOCALE` to your code (e.g. `DE` or `CA`).

Thanks to @mkb79, whos `audible` library I used.

## A note about piracy

Note that this project does NOT ‘crack’ the DRM. It simply allows the user to use their own encryption key (fetched from Audible servers) to decrypt the audiobook in the same manner that the official audiobook playing software does.

Please only use this application for gaining full access to your own audiobooks for archiving/conversion/convenience. DeDRMed audiobooks should not be uploaded to open servers, torrents, or other methods of mass distribution. No help will be given to people doing such things. Authors, retailers, and publishers all need to make a living, so that they can continue to produce audiobooks for us to hear, and enjoy. Don’t be a parasite.
